However, this is difficult to determine because IUU fishing is by nature a clandestine activity, and often occurs in contexts that, by intention, make monitoring very difficult. Disentangling fleet activities therefore necessitates identifying and understanding how key players or actors function to support or guide IUU activities. In this regard, recent efforts have focused on identifying transshipment activities by finding and following refrigerated cargo (reefer) vessels. We suggest that bunker, or fuel vessels, may provide one solution to understanding and unraveling these IUU networks for two main reasons: they are fewer in number, are known to provide additional support to fishing vessels beyond refueling. In this respect, bunker vessels are also used to resupply provisions, and crew, thereby facilitating human trafficking and slavery, which is demonstrably rife in certain components of the commercial fishing realm (e.g., long distance or high seas fleets). Here, we illustrate how social network analysis (SNA) could be used as a methodological lens to expose previously clandestine IUU fishing fleet dynamics.

In addition, efforts to reduce poaching often fail due to a lack of capacity, resources, and/or general understanding of the drivers or influences on the behaviour (e.g. Gill et al. 2017). Thus, curtailing poaching depends on gathering detailed information to guide specifically targeted behavioural and management interventions. However, gathering information on poaching is inherently difficult because it is an illegal, clandestine, and often socially unacceptable activity.  This thesis therefore addresses this considerable knowledge gap by applying specialized techniques to measure, assess, and understand poaching. Many methods and approaches can be used to assess and measure poaching, but no single method is a panacea, because each is limited in the information it can provide and subject to different types of bias (Gavin et al. 2010; Arias 2015; Bergseth et al. 2015).
