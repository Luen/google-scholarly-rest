Coral habitats can vary in many characteristics, notably live coral cover, topographic complexity and coral diversity, but the relative effects of these habitat characteristics are often not distinguished. Here, we investigate the strength of the relationships between these habitat features and local fish diversity, abundance and community structure in the lagoon of Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. In a spatial comparison using sixty-six 2m2 quadrats, fish species richness, total abundance and community structure were examined in relation to a wide range of habitat variables, including topographic complexity, habitat diversity, coral diversity, coral species richness, hard coral cover, branching coral cover and the cover of corymbose corals. Fish species richness and total abundance were strongly associated with coral species richness and cover, but only weakly associated with topographic complexity.

We investigated the effects of elevated CO2 and reduced pH on olfactory preferences, activity levels and feeding behaviour of a common coral reef meso-predator, the brown dottyback (Pseudochromis fuscus). Predators were exposed to either current-day CO2 levels or one of two elevated CO2 levels (\u223c600 \u00b5atm or \u223c950 \u00b5atm) that may occur by 2100 according to climate change predictions. Exposure to elevated CO2 and reduced pH caused a shift from preference to avoidance of the smell of injured prey, with CO2 treated predators spending approximately 20% less time in a water stream containing prey odour compared with controls. Furthermore, activity levels of fish was higher in the high CO2 treatment and feeding activity was lower for fish in the mid CO2 treatment; indicating that future conditions may potentially reduce the ability of the fish to respond rapidly to fluctuations in food availability. Elevated activity levels of predators in the high CO2 treatment, however, may compensate for reduced olfactory ability, as greater movement facilitated visual detection of food.

These results suggest that coral-dwelling fishes are much more conspicuous against the bleached-white background, increasing their susceptibility to predation.

Unfortunately, rare species are rarely studied, so relatively little information is available on the processes constraining their distributions or limiting their numbers (Kunin and Gaston, 1993). Although the ecological processes influencing rare species may not be fundamentally different from those affecting common species, this cannot be assumed. Direct comparisons of the ecology and life histories of common and rare species, in a range of different taxa, are only now beginning to reveal the essential causes of rarity (Gaston, 1994a), but almost all the progress in this field has come from studies of terrestrial organisms. Gaston's (1994a) book entitled \"Rarity,\" one of the first attempts to review this subject comprehensively, contained almost no marine examples.  Many factors may explain why the issue of rarity has been avoided by marine ecologists. The taxonomic status of rare species in many marine taxa is uncertain (Ray and Grassle, 1991). It is always difficult to sample rare species and this may be particularly true in aquatic environments. Published accounts of the geographic distributions of rare marine species are not always reliable because rare species may not be detected by the sampling method.

Therefore, respiratory performance is expected to vary between populations at different latitudes because they experience different thermal environments. We tested for geographical variation in respiratory performance of tropical marine fishes by comparing thermal effects on resting and maximum rates of oxygen uptake for six species of coral reef fish at two locations on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. The two locations, Heron Island and Lizard Island, are separated by approximately 1200 km along a latitudinal gradient.

Substantial differences in fish communities were observed across the different coral species, with E. horrida and H. rigida supporting the most fish species and individuals.

Coral reefs support upwards of one third of all marine species of fish, so the loss of coral habitat may have substantial consequences to local fish diversity. We posit that the effects of habitat degradation will be most severe in coral regions with highest biodiversity of fishes due to greater specialization by fishes for particular coral habitats. Our novel approach to this important but untested hypothesis was to conduct the same field experiment at three geographic locations across the Indo-Pacific biodiversity gradient (Papua New Guinea; Great Barrier Reef, Australia; French Polynesia). Specifically, we experimentally explored whether the response of local fish communities to identical changes in diversity of habitat-providing corals was independent of the size of the regional species pool of fishes. We found that the proportional reduction (sensitivity) in fish biodiversity to loss of coral diversity was greater for regions with larger background species pools, reflecting variation in the degree of habitat specialization of fishes across the Indo-Pacific diversity gradient. This result implies that habitat-associated fish in diversity hotspots are at greater risk of local extinction to a given loss of habitat diversity compared to regions with lower species richness.

At a low density population a strict harem structure was found, where males maintained a tight monopoly of access and spawning rights to females. In contrast, at a high density population a loosely organised system prevailed, where females could move throughout multiple male territories. Otolith microstructure revealed the species to be annual and deposit an otolith check associated with sex-change. Growth trajectories suggested that individuals that later became males in both populations underwent a growth acceleration at sex-change. Moreover, in the high density population, individuals that later became males were those individuals that had the largest otolith size at hatching and consistently deposited larger increments throughout early larval, juvenile and female life.

Such information is made available via a wide range of abiotic and biotic cues that can be detected by organisms through various sensory modalities.

Second, increasing temperatures will have direct effects on the individual condition and fitness of some coral reef fishes. Unless these species can adapt to changing temperature regimes, it is likely that they will persist in either a small portion of their current geographical extent or move poleward, invading new habitats and potentially displacing other fish species. The third effect relates to rising CO2 levels and ocean acidification, which could have significant physiological and behavioral effects on fishes towards the latter part of this century. It is unequivocal that climate change will affect reef fishes throughout this century.

Whole brain transcriptomic data has further emphasized the importance of parental phenotypic variation in the response of juvenile fish to elevated CO2. In this study, we investigate the genome-wide proteomic responses of this variation in the brain of 5-week old spiny damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus. We compared the accumulation of proteins in the brains of juvenile A. polyacanthus from two different parental behavioral phenotypes (sensitive and tolerant) that had been experimentally exposed to short-term, long-term and inter-generational elevated CO2. Our results show differential accumulation of key proteins related to stress response and epigenetic markers with elevated CO2 exposure. Proteins related to neurological development and glucose metabolism were also differentially accumulated particularly in the long-term developmental treatment, which might be critical for juvenile development. By contrast, exposure to elevated CO2 in the parental generation resulted in only three differentially accumulated proteins in the offspring, revealing potential for inter-generational acclimation.

In the short-term (up to 2030), the projected impact of climate change on Australia's tropical coastal and demersal fishes is largely tied to the fate of critical benthic habitats, especially for coral reef environments, which are highly vulnerable to elevated temperature, ocean acidification and more intense storms. There is good evidence and strong consensus that climate-induced coral bleaching affects the community structure and abundance of reef-associated fishes, especially when it leads to the structural collapse of reef habitat. In the longer-term (after 2030), sea level rise and altered rainfall patterns are expected to also significantly alter coastal wetlands that are important nursery areas for estuarine and nearshore species. In addition to the effects of habitat degradation, warmer ocean temperatures are projected to cause distributional shifts in some tropical fishes, increasing the geographic ranges of some species and decreasing the ranges of others, including some commercially important species. Life history traits and population dynamics will be affected by warmer temperatures, with potential implications for fisheries yields. Altered oceanic circulation and ocean acidification could also have very significant effects on populations and communities of coastal fishes in the longer term.

The gills and liver showed the highest transcriptional response to OA conditions in juvenile fish regardless of the parental environment, while the brain and liver showed the greatest signal of intergenerational acclimation. Key functional pathways that were altered in the brain upon within-generational CO2 exposure were restored to control levels when parents were exposed to OA conditions. Furthermore, the expression of a new complement of genes involved in key functions was altered in the offspring only when parents were previously exposed to OA conditions.

There is potential for transgenerational acclimation, but the importance of ontogenetic timing in the transmission of environmentally induced parental effects remains mostly unknown. We aimed to disentangle the contributions of two critical ontogenetic stages (juvenile development and adult reproduction) to transgenerational plasticity, by exposing the coral reef fish Acanthochromis polyacanthus to simulated ocean warming with natural diel thermal fluctuations across two generations. By using hepatic transcriptomics, we discovered that the developmental environment of the offspring themselves had little effect on their acclimation potential at 2.5 months of life. Instead, the developmental experience of parents increased regulatory RNA production and protein synthesis, which could improve the offspring's response to warming. Conversely, reproduction in warmer water elicited stress response mechanisms, with suppression of translation and mitochondrial respiration. Mismatches between temperatures in the parental ontogenetic thermal experience deeply affected offspring gene expression profiles, and detrimental effects were also evident when warming occurred both during parents' development and reproduction. This study reveals that the previous generation's developmental temperature contributes substantially to thermal acclimation potential during early life, however prolonged heat stress will likely have adverse effects on the species' persistence."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3dv-t-kAAAAJ:sA9dB-pw3HoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.27.559693.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gsq3tkKWJ2YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}, {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY", "bib": {"title": "Coral reef fish smell leaves to find island homes (vol 275, pg 2831, 2008)", "pub_year": 2022, "citation": "PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES 289 (1989), 2022", "author": "Danielle L Dixson and Geoffrey P Jones and Philip L Munday and Serge Planes and Morgan S Pratchett and Maya Srinivasan and Craig Syms and Simon R Thorrold", "journal": "PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "volume": "289", "number": "1989", "publisher": "ROYAL SOC"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3dv-t-kAAAAJ:LXmCCkuhhTsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=613158931262055314&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kqO7oMxggggJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}, {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY", "bib": {"title": "Correction to: \u2018Coral reef fish smell leaves to find island homes\u2019 (2022) by Dixson et al.", "pub_year": 2022, "citation": "Proceedings of the Royal Society B 289 (1989), 20221243, 2022", "author": "Danielle L Dixson and Geoffrey P Jones and Philip L Munday and Serge Planes and Morgan S Pratchett and Maya Srinivasan and Craig Syms and Simon R Thorrold", "journal": "Proceedings of the Royal Society B", "volume": "289", "number": "1989", "pages": "20221243", "publisher": "The Royal Society", "abstract": "Due to an error in their calculation, the standard errors reported in table 1 of the article [1] were too small.

In the present study, we examined the influence of elevated CO 2 on the swimming performance, maximum aerobic metabolic rate (MMR) and schooling behaviour in the redbelly yellowtail fusilier (Caesio cuning). Schools were acclimated to one of two CO 2 treatments: control (400 \u00b5atm) or high-CO 2 (1000 \u00b5atm) for two weeks. Schooling dynamics were tested in a 90L swim tunnel system, at four fixed flow speeds: 15, 30, 45 and 60 cm/s. Trials were video-recorded in three dimensions and analysed for school volume, density and shape, the position preference of each individual and their nearest neighbor distance. Individual swimming performance was assessed in terms of gait transition speed (U pc) and critical swimming speed (U crit) using a continuous acceleration test. MMR was tested using standard respirometry techniques. While individual swimming performance (U pc and U crit) was not impacted by elevated CO 2 conditions, schools exhibited altered swimming behaviour, with reduced position shuffling and cohesion under elevated CO 2 conditions.

Recent studies show that the behaviour of reef fishes is impaired at projected CO2 levels 3, 4; however, individual variation exists that might promote adaptation. Here, we show a clear signature of parental sensitivity to high CO2 in the brain molecular phenotype of juvenile spiny damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, primarily driven by circadian rhythm genes. O spring of CO2-tolerant and CO2-sensitive parents were reared at near-future CO2 (754\u00b5atm) or present-day control levels (414\u00b5atm). By integrating 33 brain transcriptomes and proteomes with a de novo assembled genome we investigate the molecular responses of the fish brain to increased CO2 and the expression of parental tolerance to high CO2 in the o spring molecular phenotype. Exposure to high CO2 resulted in di erential regulation of 173 and 62 genes and 109 and 68 proteins in the tolerant and sensitive groups, respectively.

We sequenced and assembled de novo transcriptomes of adult tropical reef fish exposed developmentally or transgenerationally to projected future ocean temperatures and correlated the resulting expression profiles with acclimated metabolic traits from the same fish. We identified 69 contigs representing 53 key genes involved in thermal acclimation of aerobic capacity. Metabolic genes were among the most upregulated transgenerationally, suggesting shifts in energy production for maintaining performance at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, immune-and stress-responsive genes were upregulated transgenerationally, indicating a new complement of genes allowing the second generation of fish to better cope with elevated temperatures.

Behavioural lateralization is an expression of brain functional asymmetries, and thus provides a unique test of the hypothesis that elevated CO2 affects brain function in larval fishes. We tested the effect of near-future CO2 concentrations (880 matm) on behavioural lateralization in the reef fish, Neopomacentrus azysron. Individuals exposed to current-day or elevated CO2 were observed in a detour test where they made repeated decisions about turning left or right. No preference for right or left turns was observed at the population level. However, individual control fish turned either left or right with greater frequency than expected by chance. Exposure to elevated-CO2 disrupted individual lateralization, with values that were not different from a random expectation. These results provide compelling evidence that elevated CO2 directly affects brain function in larval fishes.

By manipulating group structure we demonstrated that both the timing of maturation and the sex of maturing individuals are socially controlled. Single juveniles did not mature, but maturation was rapidly induced by the presence of an adult partner. In addition, sex determination was found to be labile, with juveniles maturing into the opposite sex of the partner encountered.

Shallow coastal marine environments are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbances due to the close proximity to urban areas. These disturbances have led to a worldwide decline in live coral habitat, with an estimated 30 percent of reefs already seriously degraded. Habitat loss can diminish critical resources and natural biological interactions such as competition may become a dominant force in eliminating species in degrading environments. Although habitat degradation may exacerbate competition for critical resources, the relationship between habitat quality and competitive interactions is poorly understood.
