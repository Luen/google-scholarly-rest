We propose that their success is related to a unique oxygen (O2) transport system involving their extremely pH-sensitive haemoglobin (Hb). A reduction in pH reduces both Hb-O2 affinity (Bohr effect) and carrying capacity (Root effect). This, combined with a large arterial-venous pH change (\u0394pHa-v) relative to other vertebrates, may greatly enhance tissue oxygen delivery in teleosts (e.g., rainbow trout) during stress, beyond that in mammals (e.g., human). We generated oxygen equilibrium curves (OECs) at five different CO2 tensions for rainbow trout and determined that, when Hb-O2 saturation is 50% or greater, the change in oxygen partial pressure (\u0394PO2) associated with \u0394pHa-v can exceed that of the mammalian Bohr effect by at least 3-fold, but as much as 21-fold. Using known \u0394pHa-v and assuming a constant arterial-venous PO2 difference (Pa-vO2), Root effect Hbs can enhance O2 release to the tissues by 73.5% in trout; whereas, the Bohr effect alone is responsible for enhancing O2 release by only 1.3% in humans.

Populations have not recovered despite CAR management strategies, likely because CAR mortality is high; however, the basis for CAR mortality is unclear. Numerous studies associated with fishing-induced mortality were reviewed in an attempt to make generalizations as to how red snapper and other high-profile fisheries species respond to CAR.

The Root effect occurs when a reduction in pH greatly reduces Hb oxygen (O\u2082) affinity and carrying capacity, and is known to greatly enhance O\u2082 delivery to specialized structures (retia) at the eye and swimbladder. This phenomenon is thought to be a central component to the most successful adaptive radiation event in the evolutionary history of vertebrates. Here, I propose and demonstrate a role for the Root effect in general O\u2082 delivery. In Chapter 2, I demonstrated that in rainbow trout blood, which possesses a Root effect, the potential for enhanced O\u2082 delivery relative to that of an air-breathing vertebrate, such as a human, is an order of magnitude greater for a given arterial-venous blood pH change (\u0394pHa-v). However, large \u0394pHa-v are generally not thought possible away from retia. In Chapters 3 and 4, I proposed and validated a novel mechanism that induces a large \u0394pHa-v at the tissues permitting the Root effect to facilitate general O\u2082 delivery. During a generalized acidosis, teleosts secure gill O2 uptake by protecting RBC pH via adrenergically-stimulated Na\u207a/H\u207a exchange (\u03b2NHE). I proposed that short-circuiting \u03b2NHE at tissues with plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase (CA) may create a large \u0394pHa-v that could greatly enhance O\u2082 delivery. In Chapter 3 this was validated in vitro in a closed system. I also validated this mechanism in vivo (Chapter 4), where rainbow trout were implanted with fiber-optic O\u2082-sensors to monitor red muscle (RM) partial pressure of O\u2082 (PO\u2082) in real-time.

Here, we tested the effects of prolonged exposure (\u226520% of lifespan) to elevated CO2 levels (~1000 \u03bcatm) on the routine and maximal oxygen uptake rates, aerobic scope and recovery time of two tropical cephalopod species, the two-toned pygmy squid, Idiosepius pygmaeus and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ynWS968AAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=765984904100609731", "cites_id": ["765984904100609731"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article-abstract/7/1/coz024/5512142", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:w346QDZToQoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}, {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY", "bib": {"title": "Gas transport and exchange: interaction between O2 and CO2 exchange", "pub_year": 2011, "citation": "Elsevier 2, 916-920, 2011", "author": "CJ Brauner and JL Rummer", "volume": "2", "pages": "916-920", "publisher": "Elsevier", "abstract": "The interaction between O2 and CO2 in the general circulation of fish exists at the level of hemoglobin within the red blood cell, and is determined largely by the magnitude of the Bohr and Haldane effects.

Whilst considerable effort has been placed on studying the effects of climate change on fishes, much emphasis has been placed on their (eco)physiology and at the organismal level. Fishes are affected by climate change through impacts at various levels of biological organisation and through a large variety of traits, making it difficult to make generalisations regarding fish responses to climate change. Here, we briefly review the current state of knowledge of climate change effects on fishes across a wide range of subfields of fish ecology and evaluate these effects at various scales of biological organisation (from genes to ecosystems). We argue that a more holistic synthesis of the various interconnected subfields of fish ecology and integration of responses at different levels of biological organisation are needed for a better understanding of how fishes and their populations and communities might respond or adapt to the multi-stressor effects of climate change.

To understand this transition, researchers have studied movement in many extinct and extant aquatic and semi-aquatic species. The epaulette shark Hemiscillum ocellatum uses slow-to-medium walking, fast walking, and swimming forms of aquatic locomotion. We described kinematic differences between the three gaits in neonate (n=6) and juvenile (n=6) sharks hatched and reared in the laboratory. Neonates retain nutrition from an internal yolk until they develop a consistent feeding schedule (~35d post-hatch). They are then classified as juveniles, foraging for worms, crustaceans, and small fish. We hypothesized that changes in diet and feeding habits would affect gait performance between neonates and juveniles. Using video tracking software and 13 anatomical landmarks along the fins, girdles, and body mid-line, whole body velocity, duty factor, fin frequency, girdle rotation, and body curvature were calculated to identify characteristic movements of the gaits for each shark. Velocity was greater in neonates when compared to juveniles across all gaits; however, both groups increased velocity from walking to swimming. Regardless of gait, pelvic girdles had a greater range of motion than pectoral girdles for both neonates and juveniles. In juveniles, regardless of gait, the contralateral sides of the pectoral and pelvic girdles were synchronized during lateral excursions.

Within-generation responses in gene expression to end-of-century predicted CO2 levels indicate that a self-amplifying cycle in GABAergic neurotransmission is triggered, explaining previously reported neurological and behavioural impairments. Furthermore, epigenetic regulator genes exhibited a within-generation specific response, but with some divergence due to parental phenotype. Importantly, we find that altered gene expression for the majority of within-generation responses returns to baseline levels following parental exposure to elevated CO2 conditions.

We exposed Pacific Hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, to three levels of environmental hypercarbia (2%, 6% and 10% CO\u2082, balance air), and extra- and intracellular acid-base status were monitored up to 96 h of exposure. At all levels of hypercarbia, a pronounced acidosis was observed (e.g., pH_7 at 10% CO\u2082 in 3 h), but significant compensation occurred within 48 h.
